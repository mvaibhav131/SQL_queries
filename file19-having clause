The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) HAVING condition ORDER BY column_name(s);

Example:

select deptID,round(avg(empSalary),1) as "AVG Salary" from employee_info group by deptID having deptID = 23
select deptID,round(avg(empSalary),1) as "AVG Salary" from employee_info group by deptID having deptID > 20

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5 ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
