The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) ORDER BY column_name(s) ;

Example :-


select deptID from employee_info group by deptID 
select sum(empSalary) from employee_info group by deptID 
select deptID,sum(empSalary) from employee_info group by deptID 
select deptID,avg(empSalary) as "AVG Salary" from employee_info group by deptID 
select deptID,round(avg(empSalary),1) as "AVG Salary" from employee_info group by deptID 

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country;
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
