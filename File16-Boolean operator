The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition :-

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2 AND condition3 ...;
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;

Example :-

select username from table_user_login where email='wonder@woman.com'
select username from table_user_login where email='tony@stark.com' and password='tony123'
select * from table_user_login where username='spidy' and password='perter123'
select * from table_user_login where username='spidy' or password='peter123'
select * from table_user_login where username='wonder'
select * from table_user_login where not username='wonder'
select * from table_user_login where username != 'wonder'
