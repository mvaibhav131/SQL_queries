The LIMIT clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The LIMIT clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition LIMIT number.

The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table:-

SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 3 // selecting the top 3 customers

Select * from customers limit 1000 // selecting the top 1000 customers
