The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition ;

Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!



// filter the employe name whose id is 3
 select empName from employee_info where empId=3

// Select all customers from Mexico:
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico';
