A subquery is embedded inside another query and acts as input or output for that query. 

Subqueries are also called inner queries and they can be used in various complex operations in SQL.

Here is an example of a subquery:-

SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t2); In this example.
SELECT * FROM t1 ... is the outer query (or outer statement), and (SELECT column1 FROM t2) is the subquery.
