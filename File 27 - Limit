The LIMIT clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The LIMIT clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records.  //Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition LIMIT number.

The following SQL Statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table :-

SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 3.                 // selecting the top 3 customers.

Select * from customers limit 1000.              // selecting the top 1000 customers.
