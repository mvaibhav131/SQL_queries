The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table.

Copy all columns into a new table:
SELECT * INTO newtable [IN externaldb] FROM oldtable WHERE condition;

Copy only some columns into a new table:
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ... INTO newtable [IN externaldb] FROM oldtable WHERE condition;

Example:

create database CopiedSample_DB

use CopiedSample_DB

select * into emp_table_copied from Sample_DB.dbo.employee_info
select * from emp_table_copied

create table company_info(id int,name varchar(20),active int)
select * from company_info

insert into company_info values(1,'Adidas',43)


The following SQL statement creates a backup copy of Customers:
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017 FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement uses the IN clause to copy the table into a new table in another database:
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017 IN 'Backup.mdb' FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement copies only a few columns into a new table:
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName INTO CustomersBackup2017 FROM Customers;
