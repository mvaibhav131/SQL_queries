The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

Note:If Where condition not passes it will update all table data as per condition.
Example:-

// update the empName where empId is 2
update employee_info set empName='Manish' where empId=2

// update all empSalary by 1000 because not passes the where statement.
update employee_info set empSalary=empSalary+1000

// update employee_info deptId where empId is 4
update employee_info set deptID=4 where empId=4

// update 2column where empName is Sanish
update employee_info set empSalary=45000,job='Tester' where empName='Sanish'

The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city.

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
