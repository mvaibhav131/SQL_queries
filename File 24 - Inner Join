It return the all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is satisfied.
It is also called natural join, simple join, equi join(because in condition uses = operator)


syntax: Select column_names from table1name inner join table2name ON table1name.column_name = table2name.column_name

Example :-

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
);

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID)
VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 101),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 102),
(3, 'Jim', 'Brown', 101),
(4, 'Jake', 'White', 103);

select * from Employees

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

insert into Departments (DepartmentID,DepartmentName) values (101,'Sales'),(102,'Marketing'),(103,'Developer')

select * from Departments

Now join the both table according to departmentId

select * from Employees inner join Departments on Employees.DepartmentID=Departments.DepartmentID

SELECT 
    Employees.EmployeeID, 
    Employees.FirstName, 
    Employees.LastName, 
    Departments.DepartmentName
FROM 
    Employees
INNER JOIN 
    Departments
ON 
    Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
